'Whalegame

This game was inspired by Roland Kofler's Matthew: https://rolandkofler.github.io/matthew/

''The basics

The main objective of the game it to show that you are the biggest whale in the sea by bidding out the last player. If you manage to stay on the top of the whale kingdom for 21 blocks or around 5 minutes, you win a portion of the pool.

''Risk

In this game you deicide how much of your funds want to risk. If you don't end up to be the winner you get the part of your bid back which you didn't risk, and the other part gets added to the pool. On the other hand if you are the winner, you will win a portion of the pool relative to the amount you have risked. For example if you risked 5% which is the minimum, you will win the 5% of the pool minus a little fee, if you risked 90%, you win 90% of the pool minus a little fee.

''Paybacks and payouts

People, who got outbid get their non risked part paid back when the next transaction happens. In other words, when they get outbid.
Winners will be either paid out when the first player of the next round sends their transaction, or they or anyone else can trigger the payout with a special free transaction where only gas costs apply.
